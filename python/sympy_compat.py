"""Backward compatibility for older sympy versions (>= 0.7.1)
   Basically a lot of monkey-patching.

   Make sure to load the file after importing sympy.*
   Also make sure to use execfile(..) to do so, in order for the patches
   to be applied.

   This file has been created to work primarily with ikfast, but should
   be applicable to other files that use sympy as well.
   However, this requires a "from sympy import ..." prior to loading the
   file.
